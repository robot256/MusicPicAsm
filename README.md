Musical tone generator for PIC16F819 and similar microcontrollers.

This is a dinky little program I wrote to play back custom-encoded songs.  The tones are generated by controlling the frequency of square waves produced on four separate pins.  Using analog multiplexers, I created a 2-bit digital-to-analog converter by giving each pin equal weight at a summing junction, then fed it to an audio amplifier.  I don't remember much more than that given how long ago it was.  Also I think the second song in the file might not work anymore, after the last change in data format, but the default Star Wars theme should work fine.
